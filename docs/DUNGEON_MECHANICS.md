# BubbleDungeons - Enhanced Completion & Spawning Mechanics

## New Dungeon Completion Logic

### 🏆 **Win Conditions**
Dungeons are now completed **ONLY** when **ALL enemies are defeated**:

**For Dungeons with Bosses:**
- ✅ All regular mobs **AND** the boss must be killed
- ❌ Killing only the boss or only the mobs is not enough
- 🔄 If boss dies first, players get message: *"The boss has fallen, but minions remain!"*
- 🔄 If all mobs die first, players get message: *"All minions defeated! The boss is now vulnerable!"*

**For Dungeons without Bosses:**
- ✅ All regular mobs must be killed
- 🔄 Wave system (if enabled) still functions normally

### ☠️ **Fail Conditions**
Dungeons now fail when **ALL players in the dungeon die**:

- 🔍 System checks if any players are alive and not dead
- 💀 If all players are dead/offline, dungeon fails immediately
- 📢 Players get message: *"All players have died! Dungeon failed."*
- 🔄 All players teleported back to main world spawn
- 🧹 Dungeon state completely cleaned up

### 🎯 **Ground-Level Spawning**
All mobs and bosses now spawn at the same level as players:

**Before:**
- Mobs: Player Y level + random offset
- Boss: Player Y level + 2 blocks (floating)

**After:**
- Mobs: Exact same Y level as player spawn point
- Boss: Exact same Y level as player spawn point
- Result: Fair combat with no elevation advantages

## Technical Implementation

### 🔧 **Player Death Tracking**
```java
@EventHandler
public void onPlayerDeath(PlayerDeathEvent e) {
    // Check if all players in dungeon are dead
    // If yes, fail the dungeon and cleanup
}
```

### 🎮 **Enhanced Mob Death Logic**
```java
// Boss death: Check if mobs remain
if(bossDungeon != null) {
    boolean allMobsDead = (remainingMobs <= 0);
    if (allMobsDead) completeDungeon();
    else notifyPlayersMinionsRemain();
}

// Mob death: Check if boss remains  
if(dd.boss() != null && dd.boss().enabled()) {
    boolean bossStillAlive = bossToDungeon.values().contains(dungeon);
    if (!bossStillAlive && !anyMobsLeft) completeDungeon();
}
```

### 📍 **Spawn Location Fix**
```java
// Boss spawning - was: base.clone().add(0, 2, 0)
Location bossLoc = base.clone(); // Same level as players

// Mob spawning already at correct level
Vector off = new Vector(random.nextInt(spawnRadius*2+1)-spawnRadius, 0, random.nextInt(spawnRadius*2+1)-spawnRadius);
```

## Player Experience Changes

### ✨ **Improved Feedback**
- Clear messages when boss vs mobs die first
- Explicit failure notification when all players die
- Visual clarity on what's needed to complete

### ⚖️ **Balanced Combat**
- No more floating bosses giving unfair advantages
- All entities fight on equal ground level
- Consistent spawn positioning

### 🎯 **Strategic Depth**
- Players must manage both boss and mob threats
- Can't rush just the boss or just the mobs
- Requires tactical coordination for completion

### 🛡️ **Fail-Safe Mechanics**
- Dungeons can't get stuck in incomplete state
- Automatic cleanup when all players die
- Prevents resource leaks and orphaned dungeons

## Configuration Compatibility

All existing features remain unchanged:
- ✅ Boss immunity system (mobs protect boss)
- ✅ Wave system support
- ✅ Test run mode
- ✅ Safe mode
- ✅ Economy rewards and loot
- ✅ Advancement system
- ✅ MythicMobs integration
- ✅ Multiverse-Core compatibility

## Benefits

1. **Fairer Combat**: Ground-level spawning ensures balanced fights
2. **Complete Victory**: Must defeat ALL enemies, not just boss
3. **Proper Failure**: Dungeons end appropriately when team wipes
4. **Better UX**: Clear feedback on completion requirements  
5. **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup prevents server issues

The plugin now provides a more complete and balanced dungeon experience! 🎉
