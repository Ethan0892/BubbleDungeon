# üöÄ BubbleDungeon Complete Enhancement Suite
## Lightweight Performance-Optimized Features

Your BubbleDungeon plugin has been massively enhanced with **all requested improvements** except community features, designed to be **lightweight and server-friendly**!

## üìä **Performance Optimization System**

### **Smart Performance Manager**
- **Dynamic TPS Monitoring**: Automatically adjusts features based on server performance
- **Hibernation System**: Inactive dungeons use minimal resources (5+ minutes inactivity)
- **Batch Processing**: Processes max 5 mobs per tick to prevent lag spikes
- **Dynamic Follow Range**: Adjusts mob detection range (32-128 blocks) based on server health

### **Resource Management**
```yaml
performance:
  enabled: true
  target-tps: 18.0              # Optimal performance target
  critical-tps: 15.0            # Emergency performance mode threshold
  hibernation:
    enabled: true
    inactive-threshold: 300000   # 5 minutes before hibernation
  mob-limits:
    max-per-dungeon: 50         # Prevents mob overload
    batch-processing: 5         # Lightweight processing
```

## ü§ñ **Enhanced Mob AI System**

### **Tactical Role Assignment**
- **Tank Mobs**: High HP, defensive, draws aggro with taunt abilities
- **DPS Mobs**: Fast hit-and-run tactics, speed bursts, kiting behavior  
- **Support Mobs**: Heals allies, debuffs players, stays back from combat
- **Elite Mobs**: Boss-like with multiple abilities and adaptive behavior

### **Formation Combat**
- **Coordinated Attacks**: Mobs work together in 5-block radius formations
- **Strategic Positioning**: Automatic positioning around players
- **Ability Cooldowns**: Smart ability management (10-25 second cooldowns)

```yaml
enhanced-ai:
  enabled: true
  role-assignment: true         # Tank/DPS/Support/Elite roles
  formation-attacks: true       # Coordinated mob positioning
  tactical-abilities: true      # Special mob abilities
```

## üê≤ **Advanced Dragon Mechanics**

### **Health-Based Phase Transitions**
- **75%+ Health**: Circling phase (standard behavior)
- **50-75% Health**: Aggressive phase (+20% aggression, speed boost)
- **25-50% Health**: Enraged phase (+50% aggression, summons minions)
- **0-25% Health**: Desperate phase (double aggression, environmental chaos)

### **Dynamic Boss Behavior**
- **Minion Summoning**: Spawns 2-3 phantom minions every 30 seconds when enraged
- **Environmental Attacks**: Creates fire patches during desperate phase
- **Phase Announcements**: Dramatic messages to players during transitions
- **Anti-Escape System**: Prevents dragons from flying away via phase control

```yaml
dragon-enhancements:
  enabled: true
  phase-transitions: true       # Health-based behavior changes
  minion-summoning: true        # Summons help when needed
  environmental-attacks: true   # Fire patches and hazards
  desperation-threshold: 0.25   # When desperate phase begins
```

## ‚öîÔ∏è **Dynamic Difficulty Scaling**

### **Intelligent Adaptation**
- **Player Count Scaling**: More players = higher difficulty automatically
- **Skill-Based Adjustment**: Adapts to player equipment and health levels
- **Real-Time Balancing**: Adjusts every 10 seconds based on performance
- **Multiplier Range**: 0.5x to 2.0x difficulty scaling

### **Performance Calculation**
```java
// Automatic difficulty calculation
difficultyMultiplier = 0.8 + (playerCount * 0.3) + (avgPlayerLevel * 0.1);
// Considers: base difficulty + group size + equipment quality
```

## üå™Ô∏è **Environmental Enhancement System**

### **Lightweight Hazards**
- **Fire Patches**: Temporary 10-second fire hazards during dragon desperate phase
- **Damage Zones**: 2.0 damage per tick when players enter hazard areas
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Hazards automatically remove themselves for performance
- **Smart Placement**: Strategic placement around combat areas

### **Visual Effects** (Optional)
- **Particle Effects**: Lightweight particles for abilities and phase changes
- **Boss Health Bars**: Enhanced health displays with phase indicators
- **Combat Indicators**: Visual feedback for special attacks

```yaml
environmental:
  enabled: true
  hazards:
    enabled: true
    fire-patches: true          # Temporary fire during dragon desperate phase
    hazard-duration: 10000      # 10-second duration
    damage-per-tick: 2.0        # Moderate damage
```

## üìà **Player Progression System**

### **Smart Tracking**
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks player actions and session duration
- **Skill Assessment**: Calculates player "level" based on equipment/health
- **Session Data**: Monitors player activity for difficulty scaling
- **Lightweight Storage**: Uses memory-only tracking, no disk I/O during combat

### **Progression Integration**
- **Difficulty Input**: Player skill feeds into dynamic difficulty
- **Reward Scaling**: Better performance = better rewards (optional)
- **Activity Tracking**: Monitors player engagement for hibernation system

## üéÆ **Enhanced Gameplay Features**

### **Advanced Combat Mechanics**
