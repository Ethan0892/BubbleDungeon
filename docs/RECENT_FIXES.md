# BubbleDungeon Recent Fixes

## Issues Fixed in Latest Update

### 1. ✅ **Fixed Key Spamming Issue in Advancement Creation**
- **Problem**: Advancement creation was using keys with `:` which caused chat spam
- **Solution**: Changed advancement keys from `"bubbledungeons:participation"` to `"bubbledungeons_participation"` format
- **Applied to**: All three advancement methods (participation, first boss, all bosses)
- **Added**: Smart logging that suppresses "already exists" messages to prevent spam

### 2. ✅ **Fixed Boss Bar Display Issues**
- **Problem**: Boss bar was showing to all players regardless of dungeon participation
- **Solution**: Modified `DungeonProgressHUD.java` to only show boss bars to players actually in the dungeon
- **Improved**: Added better comments and cleaner logic for boss bar management
- **Result**: Boss bars now only appear for players currently in dungeons

### 3. ✅ **Added Big Title Screen on Dungeon Entry**
- **Problem**: No visual feedback when entering dungeons
- **Solution**: Added `sendTitle()` call in `doJoin()` method
- **Features**: 
  - Main title shows dungeon name in gold and bold
  - Subtitle shows "Prepare for adventure!" in gray italic
  - Duration: 2 seconds display time with fade in/out effects
  - Timing: 10 ticks fade in, 40 ticks stay, 10 ticks fade out

### 4. ✅ **Fixed Critical Data Type Bug**
- **Problem**: `playerBossDefeats` stores `Set<String>` but code was trying to get integer
- **Solution**: Fixed advancement progress display to properly handle the Set data structure
- **Result**: `/dungeon progress` command now works correctly showing boss defeat counts

### 5. ✅ **Fixed Multiverse-Core Command Spam Issues**
- **Problem**: Invalid Multiverse command syntax causing console spam
- **Root Cause**: Commands used wrong format `mv modify set <property> <value> <world>` instead of `mv modify <world> set <property> <value>`
- **Solutions**:
  - Fixed command syntax to proper format: `mv modify <world> set <property> <value>`
  - Added world existence checking to prevent repeated creation attempts
  - Added caching system to prevent duplicate world creation attempts
  - Added proper cache cleanup on both success and failure
  - Added verification before running world modification commands

### 6. ✅ **Enhanced World Creation System**
- **Added**: `worldCreationAttempts` cache using `ConcurrentHashMap.newKeySet()`
