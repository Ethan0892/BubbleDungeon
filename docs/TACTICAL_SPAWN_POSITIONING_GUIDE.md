# üéØ Tactical Spawn Positioning Guide

## üìã Overview
The BubbleDungeon plugin now features tactical spawn positioning that creates strategic gameplay encounters with specific coordinates and facing directions for bosses, minions, and players.

## üó∫Ô∏è Spawn Coordinate System

### Universal Coordinates (Applied to All Dungeons)
- **Boss Spawn**: `x: 8, y: 49, z: 8` facing **EAST**
- **Player Spawn**: `x: 28, y: 48, z: 8` facing **WEST**
- **Minion Spawn**: 2-3 block radius around boss facing **EAST**

### Strategic Positioning Benefits
1. **20-Block Separation**: Boss and player spawn 20 blocks apart for tactical positioning
2. **Direct Line of Sight**: Player spawns facing west, directly toward the boss
3. **Defensive Formation**: Minions spawn around boss in 2-3 block radius facing east
4. **Height Advantage**: Player spawns 1 block lower than boss for tactical approach

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Updates

### Per-Dungeon Spawn Settings
```yaml
dungeons:
  sample:
    # Player spawn location and facing direction
    player-spawn:
      x: 28
      y: 48
      z: 8
      facing: WEST
    # Boss spawn location
    boss-spawn:
      x: 8
      y: 49
      z: 8
      facing: EAST
```

### Global Spawn Configuration
```yaml
# Radius around boss for minions to spawn (2-3 blocks)
minion-spawn-radius: 3

# Direction minions should face when spawning
minion-facing: EAST
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Mob Spawning
- **Minion Positioning**: Spawn within 2-3 block radius of boss location
- **Facing Direction**: All minions face EAST by default (configurable)
- **Safe Spawning**: All entities use enhanced safe spawning system
- **Random Distribution**: Minions spawn at random angles around boss within radius

### Player Teleportation
- **Safe Spawning**: Players teleport to safe ground near configured coordinates
- **Facing Direction**: Players automatically face the configured direction
- **Pitch Control**: Players look straight ahead (0¬∞ pitch) when spawning

### Boss Positioning
- **Exact Coordinates**: Boss spawns at precise x:8, y:49, z:8 location
- **Facing Direction**: Boss faces EAST by default
- **Safe Spawning**: Uses enhanced safe spawning for void protection

## üéÆ Gameplay Experience

### Tactical Encounter Flow
1. **Player Entry**: Spawns at x:28, y:48, z:8 facing west
2. **Boss Positioning**: Boss at x:8, y:49, z:8 facing east (direct line of sight)
3. **Minion Formation**: 2-3 minions spawn around boss in defensive formation
4. **Strategic Combat**: 20-block approach with clear sight lines and positioning

### Enhanced Features
- **Safe Spawning**: All spawn locations use enhanced safe spawning system
- **Emergency Platforms**: 3x3 platforms created if spawning in void
- **Facing Directions**: Automatic orientation for all entities
- **Consistent Experience**: Same positioning across all dungeons

## üìç Coordinate Details

### Sample Dungeon
- **World**: `dungeon_world`
- **Dungeon Base**: `x: 0, y: 64, z: 0`
- **Boss Location**: `x: 8, y: 49, z: 8` (EAST facing)
- **Player Spawn**: `x: 28, y: 48, z: 8` (WEST facing)
- **Distance**: 20 blocks separation

### Crypt Dungeon
- **World**: `dungeon_world`
- **Dungeon Base**: `x: 200, y: 64, z: 0`
- **Boss Location**: `x: 8, y: 49, z: 8` (EAST facing)
- **Player Spawn**: `x: 28, y: 48, z: 8` (WEST facing)
- **Distance**: 20 blocks separation

### Volcano Dungeon
- **World**: `dungeon_world`
- **Dungeon Base**: `x: 0, y: 64, z: 200`
- **Boss Location**: `x: 8, y: 49, z: 8` (EAST facing)
- **Player Spawn**: `x: 28, y: 48, z: 8` (WEST facing)
- **Distance**: 20 blocks separation

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Changes Summary

### Enhanced Mob Spawning (`spawnDungeonMobs`)
- Changed minion spawning from base location to boss location
- Added `spawnMinionAroundBoss()` method for tactical positioning
- Implemented radius-based spawning with facing direction

### New Methods Added
- `spawnMinionAroundBoss()`: Spawns minions in tactical formation around boss
- `getYawFromBlockFace()`: Converts facing directions to yaw values
- Enhanced `teleportToDungeon()`: Includes facing direction and safe spawning
- Enhanced `spawnBoss()`: Includes facing direction configuration

### Configuration Integration
- `minion-spawn-radius`: Configurable radius for minion spawning (default: 3)
- `minion-facing`: Direction minions face when spawning (default: EAST)
- Per-dungeon `player-spawn.facing` and `boss-spawn.facing` support

## üéØ Strategic Benefits

### For Players
- **Predictable Positioning**: Consistent spawn points across all dungeons
- **Strategic Approach**: 20-block approach distance for tactical planning
- **Clear Objectives**: Direct line of sight to boss encounter
- **Defensive Awareness**: Minion formation visible from spawn

### For Server Admins
- **Consistent Experience**: Same tactical layout for all dungeons
- **Balanced Encounters**: Strategic positioning prevents camping
- **Configurable Options**: Adjustable spawn radius and facing directions
- **Safe Spawning**: No fall damage or void deaths

### For Multiplayer Teams
- **Team Coordination**: Consistent spawn points for team strategy
- **Role Assignment**: Predictable positioning for tank/DPS/support roles
- **Communication**: Known positions improve team coordination
- **Fair Encounters**: Balanced positioning for all team members

## üîÑ Compatibility
