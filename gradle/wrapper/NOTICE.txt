The gradle-wrapper.jar binary is normally generated by running 'gradle wrapper'.
Because this environment created files programmatically, you must generate the wrapper locally:

On a machine with Gradle installed:
  gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.8
Then copy the generated gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar into this directory.
